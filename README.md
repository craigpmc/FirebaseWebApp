# FirebaseWebApp
Web application with Firebase and ReactJS

# Choices
I have chosen ReactJS and Bootstrap (v4) because I work with these libraries every days.
React because it is quickly to have an environment with react-create-app.
Bootstrap because this is the best UI framework ever. And in version 4 because I think it is better than the version 3.

# Progression
I am done the exercice. I create a project with Firebase and npm environment.
We can find an authentification part and main page with a logo.
I recover informations API and put in Firebase Database.
Calculate average ages pilots and display it.
App is responsive (web app...).
App is available on my github account.

'BONUS':
- I use two libraries (ReactJS / Bootstrap)
- I develop routes (via react-rooter)
- Authentification (log in, log out) and there are errors on fields

# Defaults
I use reactJS but the application is very lite.
It would have been better to use react-lite for example.
Another point is how bootstrap is imported. I decided to import bootstrap by CDN in head tag, because it is
more quickly than install via npm and use require/import.
Finally, react-create-app is a good tool for develop quickly and start from scratch easier, but this is not the same
quality than a project with a good webpack, etc.
