# FirebaseWebApp
Web application with Firebase and ReactJS

## Technical choice
I've decided to use ReactJS to develop UI because this is the framework with which I have the most experience.
I use create-react-app to develop quickly (installed by npm).
### Defaults
With React, the ecosystem is very heavy and long to install.
This web app is very lite and there are many libraries better than ReactJS, but thinking to futures improves of application.
